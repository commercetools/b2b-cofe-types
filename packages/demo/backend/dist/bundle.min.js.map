**connectionTimeout** - how many milliseconds to wait for the connection to establish\n *  * **socketTimeout** - Time of inactivity until the connection is closed (defaults to 1 hour)\n *  * **lmtp** - if true, uses LMTP instead of SMTP protocol\n *  * **logger** - bunyan compatible logger interface\n *  * **debug** - if true pass SMTP traffic to the logger\n *  * **tls** - options for createCredentials\n *  * **socket** - existing socket to use instead of creating a new one (see: http://nodejs.org/api/net.html#net_class_net_socket)\n *  * **secured** - boolean indicates that the provided socket has already been upgraded to tls\n *\n * @constructor\n * @namespace SMTP Client module\n * @param {Object} [options] Option properties\n */\nclass SMTPConnection extends EventEmitter
